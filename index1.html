                <h3>401k's Plan</h3>
                <p>401k’s are savings and investment plans that employers offer. 401k’s allow great flexibility in contributions, which is how much money you put into the account. 401’k is great if cash flow is not constant and employers may offer more than IRA plans. The downside to 401k’s. They carry significant fees which make it harder to grow your savings over time? If you withdraw before the age of 59.5 , you will have to pay a penalty and investment options are limited.</p>

                <h3>Roth IRA</h3>
                <p>Roth IRAs are retirement accounts , in which you can invest tax-free money , which means adding money that has been taxed and paid already. But this also means that there are no tax deductions .Roth IRA’s do not have minimum distributions ,meaning you do not have to pull out money until you choose too. There are some limits to Roth IRA’s. One of these limits is that there is an income limit , which must be  $144,000 or less. You cannot withdraw earnings before the age of 59.5 and you will need other retirement accounts to save enough for retirement.</p>
